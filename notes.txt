# SOAHC-NIKCUF Unity Project Setup Notes

## Project Overview
- Creating a new Unity project based on an existing TypeScript project
- Setting up GitHub integration and optimizing our work environment

## Git Repository Setup
- Repository already exists at https://github.com/RichEdd/SOAHC-NIKCUF-Unity
- Encountered and resolved several Git issues:
  1. "Destination path already exists" - Attempted to clone into non-empty directory
  2. "Please commit your changes before merging" - Had uncommitted local changes
  3. "Refusing to merge unrelated histories" - Local and remote repositories had different histories
- Used `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories` to merge the repositories

## Unity Project Setup
1. Unity Project Configuration:
   - Choose appropriate template (3D, 2D, HDRP, URP)
   - Set up with latest LTS Unity version for stability

2. TypeScript Integration Options:
   - Unity TypeScript Transpiler
   - Puerts (TypeScript runtime for Unity)
   - Bridge.NET (C# to JavaScript/TypeScript converter)

## Repository Structure
- Organized project with clear separation:
  - Unity project in dedicated directory
  - TypeScript code in its own directory
  - Shared assets properly managed

## Workflow Optimization
1. Git Configuration:
   - Proper .gitignore for both Unity and TypeScript
   - Git LFS for large Unity assets
   - Branch strategy for feature development

2. Development Environment:
   - VS Code setup with extensions for Unity and TypeScript
   - Consistent development environment across team members
   - Linting and formatting tools configuration

3. Collaboration Tools:
   - GitHub workflow with pull requests
   - Documentation for team members
   - Potential CI/CD pipeline setup

## Next Steps
1. Complete Unity project setup in repository
2. Configure TypeScript integration
3. Set up proper testing framework
4. Document development workflow for team
5. Implement initial project structure

## Notes on Git Issues Encountered
- When working with existing repositories, always pull before making changes
- Use `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
- For repositories with different histories, use `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag
- Consider using Git GUI tools for easier repository management
