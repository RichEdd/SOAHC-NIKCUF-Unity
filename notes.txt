# SÖAHC NIKCUF (Unity Version)

A 2D platform fighter game built with Unity, featuring elemental powers and unique combat mechanics. This is a parallel development project alongside the TypeScript/Phaser version.

## Project Overview

This Unity implementation aims to enhance the original game concept with:
- Advanced physics-based combat
- Enhanced visual effects
- Improved multiplayer capabilities
- More dynamic character interactions

## Development Status

This project is in the initial setup phase, integrating the existing TypeScript codebase with Unity. We've established the GitHub repository and are configuring the development environment.

### Planned Features

- Two-player local multiplayer
- Elemental-based combat system
- Dynamic projectile mechanics with improved physics
- Enhanced visual effects system
- Platform-based movement and combat
- Team-based gameplay foundation

## Development Setup

### Requirements
- Unity (Latest LTS Version)
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with Unity tools
- Git LFS (for handling large binary files)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RichEdd/SOAHC-NIKCUF-Unity.git
```

2. Open the project in Unity Hub
3. Open the project in Unity Editor
4. Install required Unity packages (list TBD)

### TypeScript Integration

We're exploring several options for TypeScript integration:
- Unity TypeScript Transpiler
- Puerts (TypeScript runtime for Unity)
- Bridge.NET (C# to JavaScript/TypeScript converter)

## Project Structure

- `Assets/`
  - `Scripts/` - C# scripts
  - `Prefabs/` - Reusable game objects
  - `Scenes/` - Unity scenes
  - `Materials/` - Materials and shaders
  - `Sprites/` - 2D graphics
  - `Animations/` - Animation files
  - `Effects/` - Particle systems and effects
- TypeScript code in dedicated directory (structure TBD)

## Workflow and Collaboration

We've established a Git workflow with:
- Proper .gitignore for both Unity and TypeScript
- Git LFS for large Unity assets
- Branch strategy for feature development
- Documentation for team members

## Parallel Development

This project is developed in parallel with the TypeScript/Phaser version (SOAHC-NIKCUF). See the following resources:
- Original TypeScript version: [Link to original repo]
- Project notes: notes.txt
- Feature comparison tracking in project documentation

## Git Notes

When working with this repository:
- Always pull before making changes
- Use `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
- For repositories with different histories, use `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag
- Consider using Git GUI tools for easier repository management

## Next Steps

1. Complete Unity project setup in repository
2. Configure TypeScript integration
3. Set up proper testing framework
4. Document development workflow for team
5. Implement initial project structure

## Contributing

This project is in early development. Contribution guidelines will be established as the project progresses.
